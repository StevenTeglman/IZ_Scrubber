# IZ_Scrubber #
This program was created to assist with my job as a Customer Scrubber which involved going through customers profiles and deciding whether or not we should accept them, based on the parameters presented. `iz_scrubber.py` is the file with all the good stuff in it.

To use the program, you would have to first open `iz_scrubber.py` file in your favourite editior, and replace the `INSERT USERNAME` and `INSERT PASSWORD` with your credentials. After that, simply run the `iz_scrubber.py` file from your console and you are good to go!
